## Practice Statement - Report Generation

**Educational institutions are overburdened with paperwork and manual processes. They find it difficult to maintain records of the studentsâ€™ results, their attendance, assessments, etc. Administrators at the Oak Bridge School have already conducted exams and completed evaluations for high school students. Teachers must work with technical teams to set up an automated grading system. Each team is assigned a task.**
